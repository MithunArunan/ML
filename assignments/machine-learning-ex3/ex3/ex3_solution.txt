Ex 3
----
Multi Class classification problem - 10 class (0 to 9)
Two techniques to solve this
1. Using One vs All logisitic regression implementation with regularization
2. Neural networks 

Load the training data set into X and y
X is a 20*20 images to predict a number between 0 to 9 So output will be 

Select a random theta value and improve the hypothesis
[-2; -1; 1; 2]
